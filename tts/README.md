# Django TTS Module

A modular Text-to-Speech (TTS) component for Django projects that converts text into spoken audio using Google's Text-to-Speech service.

## About

This module provides a simple way to add text-to-speech functionality to your Django applications. It uses the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert text into natural-sounding speech in multiple languages. The module is designed to be easily integrated into any Django project and can be used either as a standalone service or alongside other features like translation.

## How to Use

### Installation

1. Install the required package:
```bash
pip install gTTS
```

2. Add 'tts' to your Django project's `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'tts',
    ...
]
```

3. Include the TTS URLs in your project's `urls.py`:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('tts/', include('tts.urls')),
    ...
]
```

### Basic Usage

#### As a Service
```python
from tts.services import text_to_speech, get_audio_base64

# Generate speech and get audio buffer
audio_buffer = text_to_speech("Hello, world!", language="en")

# Generate speech and get base64 encoded audio
encoded_audio = get_audio_base64("Hello, world!", language="en")
```

#### Using the API Endpoints

1. Get supported languages:
```http
GET /tts/languages/
```

2. Generate speech (returns base64 encoded audio):
```http
POST /tts/generate/
{
    "text": "Hello, world!",
    "language": "en"
}
```

## How It Works

### Core Components

1. **Services (`services.py`)**
   - `text_to_speech()`: Converts text to speech and returns an audio buffer
   - `get_audio_base64()`: Converts text to speech and returns base64 encoded audio
   - `get_supported_languages()`: Returns a list of supported languages
   - `is_language_supported()`: Checks if a language is supported

2. **Views (`views.py`)**
   - `get_languages()`: API endpoint to get supported languages
   - `generate_speech()`: API endpoint to generate speech and return base64 audio

3. **URLs (`urls.py`)**
   - Maps the API endpoints to URLs

### Example Integration

Here's how you might use the TTS module in a translation app:

```python
from tts.services import is_language_supported, get_audio_base64

def translate_and_speak(text, target_language):
    # First translate the text (using your translation service)
    translated_text = translate_text(text, target_language)
    
    # Then generate speech if the language is supported
    if is_language_supported(target_language):
        audio = get_audio_base64(translated_text, target_language)
        return {
            'text': translated_text,
            'audio': audio
        }
    return {'text': translated_text}
```

### Best Practices

1. Always check if a language is supported before trying to generate speech
2. Handle exceptions gracefully - TTS might fail for various reasons
3. Consider caching frequently used audio to improve performance

## Limitations

- Requires an internet connection (uses Google's TTS service)
- Has a limit on the length of text that can be converted at once
- Some languages might not be supported
- Audio quality depends on the language and text content
